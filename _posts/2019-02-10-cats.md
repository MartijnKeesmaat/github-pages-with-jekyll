The cat or domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.[4] The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet; or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]
